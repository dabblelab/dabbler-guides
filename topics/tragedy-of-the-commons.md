## Tragedy of the commons

Tragedy of the Commons is an economic term that describes a situation in which individual users, acting independently and rationally according to each one's self-interest, will ultimately deplete a shared limited resource, even when it is clear that it is not in anyone's long-term interest for this to happen. This concept was first described by Garrett Hardin in an influential 1968 paper titled "The Tragedy of the Commons." This concept applies to software development projects that include a number of contributors who all have their own goals and objectives and who, over time, may all make decisions that are beneficial to them individually but that ultimately lead to the failure of the project. This concept can be used to describe a number of software development scenarios, such as when developers are competing for limited resources or when there is a lack of clear ownership of the project. In such cases, it is important to establish clear ownership and communication channels in order to ensure that all contributors are working towards the same goal and that decisions are made in the best interest of the project as a whole.
