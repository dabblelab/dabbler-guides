## Complexity Creep

Complexity creep is the tendency for a system or process to become increasingly complex over time due to the accumulation of additional features, tasks, and other elements. This usually happens as a result of the need to accommodate new requirements or changes in the system or process. As complexity increases, it can become more difficult to maintain and manage the system, leading to inefficiencies and potential problems.

The impact this has on a software project is increased cost, longer development times, and often a poorer user experience. Complexity creep can also increase the risk of system failure, as the complexity introduces more potential points of failure. This can also lead to decreased user satisfaction as the system becomes harder to use.

To avoid complexity creep in a software project, it is important to ensure that all requirements are well defined and agreed upon before development begins. Additionally, careful attention should be paid to design and architecture so as to minimize the complexity of the system and ensure that all elements are working together in a cohesive way. Finally, regular maintenance and review should be conducted to ensure that the system remains up to date and is not becoming overly complex.
