# Dabbler Guides
In 2023, Dabble Lab will publish a series of short books on our practices. We are tentatively calling these Dabbler Guides. The mission is to help team members and clients better understand how we work and why, while also creating evidence of our thought leadership.

We will publish these books digitally—PDF versions available on our website and e-book versions available for Kindle. We’re aiming to have 5 books published by June 1, 2023. 

Each guide will be numbered for ease of reference and focus on how we approach different aspects of our business. For example:

Dabbler Guide 1: Project Planning
Dabbler Guide 2: Project Management
Dabbler Guide 3: Team Development
Dabbler Guide 4: Business Development
Dabbler Guide 5: Business Operations

The primary goal is to provide the how’s and why’s for Dabble Lab in a way that is clear and ensures quality and alignment as we grow. The secondary goal is to share with the World what we believe are best practices.
